I’m excited to share my internship journey at Oasis Infobyte, where I had the opportunity to work on hands-on projects and strengthen my programming and analytical skills.
During this internship, I developed:
BMI Calculator (Python) – a desktop application to calculate and categorize BMI.
Secure Password Generator (Python) – a tool to generate strong, customizable passwords.
Weather Forecast Web App (Java
Script) – a web application fetching real-time weather data using APIs.
